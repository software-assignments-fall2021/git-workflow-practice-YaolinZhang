## [Test-Driven Development](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development)

When I first heard about Test-Driven Development was in my Data Structures course. At that time, I was very confused about how one could even write unit tests for non-existent program or code as if you ask me how a cookie tastes like when you give me nothing. So this format of development did not make any sense to me back then. Later on, I found this article well explained about how TDD looks like. By writing the tests first instead of the actual code, it makes the purpose of program in each class and function cleaner and more straightforward, which helps developers implements them faster and more efficiently rather than make changes back and forth as if after you image the cookie should taste like in your mouth it is then much easier to make the cookie with just the right amount of suger and powder.


Very interesting article! I like the cookie reference! - Elizabeth Jiranek (ej984)

I think this is a helfpul article that provides some practice of testing the software.
